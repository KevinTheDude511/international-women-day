# International Women Day
## What is this?
The International Women's Day project is a collaborative effort between me and my friend. Our aim is to send personalized wishes to all of our friends using a website application.

## Test it out for yourself
This web application is deployed using Vercel, here is the [link](https://international-women-day.vercel.app/) to the web.

To preview the format for the wishes:
- Navigate to the search bar.
- Type in 'test'.

Please note that if the web application is not responding, kindly wait for a minute for the API to be fetched.
